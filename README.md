# Bomb-Density-Reducer
So basically, drop the exe into the map folder with all the diffs. Upon running the executable, you will be prompted to enter a precision. Entering zero places bombs at 20 ms intervals, and any other value places bombs at that precision. If the desired precision makes the bombs not spaced far enough, the program automatically compensates for this. In the future, I may update this script to use the RT stacked bomb checker, but idk that math, so just criteria is what I'm going off of.
This script does assume that bomb snakes are at least .25 beats apart. This means that bombs that are spaced less than that will be treated as a snake regardless of their purpose. 

If you have any issues with this program, please alert me. I made this in like a day and barely know how to program.
